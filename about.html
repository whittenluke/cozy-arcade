    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Cozy Arcade exists to host small, calm games you can play in your browser. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

    <p>The games here are meant to be quiet experiences—no pressure, no competition, no accounts. Just something to do for a few minutes when you need a moment of calm.</p>

    <p>This isn't a platform or a community. It's not trying to grow or become something bigger. It's just a small collection of games that felt worth sharing.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for something polished or ambitious, you might be disappointed. These are simple games, made with care but without grand ambitions.</p>
